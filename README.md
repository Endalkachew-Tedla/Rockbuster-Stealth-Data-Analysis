Diving into Rockbuster Stealth's, data to answer key business queries for their business strategy. I'll identify top and bottom-performing movies, analyze rental durations, map out customer geography, pinpoint high-value customer locations, and compare sales across regions leveraging SQL. Stay tuned for actionable insights.
## Rockbuster Stealth LLC Data Analysis Project

**Introduction**: Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie l icenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive.

**Key Questions**:
- Which movies made the most money? Which made the least?
- How long, on average, do people rent videos?
- What countries do Rockbuster's customers come from?
- Where do customers who spend a lot of money live?
- Do sales numbers change depending on where they're measured?

**Context**: In this project, you'll be using SQL to analyze data from the online video streaming industry, specifically focusing on Rockbuster, a fictional company. As you progress through the tasks, you'll learn SQL incrementally, starting with basic queries and gradually tackling more complex business questions. The ultimate goal is to present your findings to Rockbuster management in a clear and easily understandable format. While the data pertains to the streaming industry, the skills you develop can be applied across various industries, showcasing your ability to solve problems using SQL. By the end of the project, you'll be proficient in using SQL to perform different types of analyses based on queries.

**Data Set**: In this task, you'll work with a dataset containing information about Rockbuster's film inventory, customers, and payments. Here's what you need to do:

- The dataset is approximately 3MB in size and comprises several files.
- Tables in the dataset are related if they share a common column name.
- To proceed, you'll first need to install PostgreSQL and load the Rockbuster dataset into it. Follow the step-by-step instructions provided in Exercise 3.1: Introduction to Relational Databases carefully.
- [Download the Rockbuster dataset](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dvdrental.zip)
- [Download PostgreSQL Database](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads) (available for Windows, macOS X, and Linux)

**Project Deliverables**: The project culminates in a comprehensive analysis, backed by SQL queries, visualizations, and a narrative that translates complex data into actionable business insights.

**Final Analysis**:
- SQL queries addressing the managementâ€™s questions.
- Visualizations in Tableau Public.
- A narrative story combining data insights with business strategies.

**Visualizations**: Check out the [Tableau Public dashboard]([https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/isom.winton/vizzes](https://endalkachew-tedla.github.io/Endalkachew-Tedla-Portfolio/projects/rockbuster/tableau.html)) for interactive insights.
